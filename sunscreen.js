  "anytime": ["Wear sunscreen.\nIf I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it\nA long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists\nWhereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable\nThan my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now..","Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind.\nYou will not understand the power and beauty of your youth\nuntil they've faded, but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back\nat photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now\nhow much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.","You are not as fat as you imagine.","Don't worry about the future\nor worry, but know that worrying\nis as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubble gum\nThe real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.\nThe kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.","Do one thing every day that scares you.","Don't be reckless with other people's hearts.\nDon't put up with people who are reckless with yours.","Floss.","Don't waste your time on jealousy.","Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.\nThe race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself.","Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults.\n(If you succeed in doing this, tell me how)","Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.","Stretch.","Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.\nThe most interesting people I know\ndidn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.\nSome of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.","Get plenty of calcium.","Be kind to your knees.\nYou'll miss them when they're gone.","Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't.\nMaybe you'll have children, maybe you won't.\nMaybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken' on your 75th wedding anniversary.\nWhatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much\nor berate yourself either.\nYour choices are half chance, so are everybody else's.","Enjoy your body, use it every way you can.\nDon't be afraid of it or what other people think of it,\nit's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.","Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room.","Read the directions even if you don't follow them.","Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.","Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good.","Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past\nand the people most likely to stick with you in the future.","Understand that friends come and go,\nbut a precious few, who should hold on.","Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle.\nFor as the older you get,\nthe more you need the people you knew when you were young.\n","Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard.\nLive in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft.","Travel.","Accept certain inalienable truths:\nPrices will rise, politicians will philander, you too, will get old\nand when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young\nprices were reasonable, politicians were noble,\nand children respected their elders.\n","Respect your elders.","Don't expect anyone else to support you.\nMaybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse\nbut you never know when either one might run out.","Don't mess too much with your hair\nor by the time you're 40 it will look 85.","Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it.\nAdvice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past\nfrom the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts\nand recycling it for more than it's worth.","But trust me on the sunscreen."]
